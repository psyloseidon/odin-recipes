    <h1>Berta's super deep fried oil</h1>

    <p>Berta got this recipe by accidently adding too much oil in her previously heated oil</p>
    <p>She ended up deep frying the oil by mistake. According to her, the end result made her fries 35% crispier</p>

    <h3>You will need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200ml oil</li>
        <li>200ml oil but later</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Before frying anything, fry your oil first!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up your oil on high heat</li>
        <li>Once it's hot, add the remaining oil</li>
        <li>Once that's hot, add your soon to be super deep fried whatever</li>
        <li>Crunch away</li>
    </ol>
